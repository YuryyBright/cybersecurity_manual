## 🔑 Password Security

### 🤔 Why It Matters
Passwords are your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords are like using the same key for your house, car, and safe - if someone gets it, they have access to everything.

### 🎯 Best Practices

#### Use a Password Manager 🔐
**Free Options:**
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - Best overall free option
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - 30-day free trial, then paid
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) - Limited free version

**Premium Options:**
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - $2.99/month
- [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) - $4.99/month
- [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/) - $2.92/month

#### Password Rules 📝
✅ **DO:**
- Use unique passwords for every account
- Make passwords at least 12 characters long
- Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Let your password manager generate them

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use personal information (birthdays, names, addresses)
- Use common passwords (123456, password, qwerty)
- Share passwords with others
- Write passwords on sticky notes

### 🛠️ Action Steps

1. **Choose and install a password manager**
2. **Import existing passwords** (most managers can do this automatically)
3. **Update weak passwords** - Look for duplicates and weak ones
4. **Set up your master password** - Make it strong but memorable
5. **Install browser extensions** for easy autofill

---

## 🛡️ Two-Factor Authentication

### 🤔 Why It Matters
2FA adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone steals your password, they still can't access your account without the second factor.

### 🔧 Best 2FA Methods (Ranked)

1. **🔐 Authenticator Apps** (Most Secure)
   - [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)
   - [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)
   - [Authy](https://authy.com/) - Has backup features

2. **📱 Hardware Keys** (Most Secure for High-Value Accounts)
   - [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) - $25-$70
   - [Google Titan](https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key) - $30-$50

3. **📱 SMS** (Better than nothing, but not ideal)
   - Can be intercepted, but still much better than no 2FA

### 🎯 Priority Accounts for 2FA

1. **Email accounts** (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
2. **Banking and financial accounts**
3. **Work accounts**
4. **Social media accounts**
5. **Shopping accounts** (Amazon, PayPal)
6. **Cloud storage** (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)

### 🛠️ Action Steps

1. **Download an authenticator app**
2. **Enable 2FA on your email first** - This protects password resets
3. **Work through your priority accounts** - One at a time
4. **Save backup codes** - Store them in your password manager
5. **Test your setup** - Make sure you can log in with 2FA
